The tests in this package each have their own license. 
The licenses are in each test folder.  Licenses include
GPL-2.0, LGPL-2.1 and Apache-2.0.

The simple test instructions in the txt files are not
considered copyrightable and thus do not need a license.
They can be used and distributed as needed.
